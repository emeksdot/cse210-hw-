Inheritance is another pillar or foundational principle of object-oriented programming where a class called a subclass or child class can inherit both member variables and methods from another class called the base/super or parent class. It enables reuse of functionality and even allows for the child class to extend its own functionality by adding other characteristics or behaviours not found in the super class.
