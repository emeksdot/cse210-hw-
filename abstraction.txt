Abstraction is a core object-oriented programming principle that helps to reduce the complexity associated with software development by hiding unnecessary details about the software objects. A good example is a Television's remote that can allow someone to increase or decrease the volume, change the channel, put off or on the television without interacting directly with the internal electrical circuits of the television.
In software development, it is also important to hide the internal implementation of software objects to enforce certain behaviour from the users of our program, so as to ensure the program works as specified and this is usually achieved by the use of classes and methods.
